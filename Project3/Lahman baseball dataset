Project Description
The project focuses on creating and analyzing a baseball player dataset using Apache Hive. The dataset includes detailed information about players, such as personal details, career milestones, and performance statistics.

Steps in the Project:
Data Setup:

Import raw data (CSV or JSON) into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
Ensure data integrity and proper formatting before loading into Hive.
Table Creation:

Define an external Hive table (baseball_master) with fields like player details (name, birthdate, country), career stats (debut, final game), and physical attributes (height, weight).
Use efficient file formats like Avro or Parquet for better storage and query performance.
Data Processing:

Use HiveQL to query, clean, and transform the data.
Filter data by specific criteria, e.g., players from certain countries or active during a specific era.
Data Analysis:

Analyze player statistics to identify trends (e.g., average player weight and height over decades).
Generate reports on player demographics, career longevity, and debut years.
Visualization and Reporting:

Integrate with tools like Tableau to create dashboards highlighting player insights.
Display graphs and tables for better data interpretation.
Outcome:
The project provides a structured dataset and meaningful insights about baseball players, which can be used for historical research, fan engagement, or statistical comparisons.
