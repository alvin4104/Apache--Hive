Project Description
The project, titled "The Roboomy of Products," involves analyzing detailed sales and operational data of products using Hadoop and Apache Hive. The dataset includes attributes related to product details, employee and operational salaries, sales metrics, revenue, growth rates, and customer feedback. The goal is to uncover insights into product performance, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

Steps in the Project:
Data Ingestion:

Import raw data (CSV or JSON) containing product details, operational metrics, and customer information into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
Data fields include ProductID, ProductName, salaries of different roles, sales quantities, revenue across quarters, growth rates, and customer feedback.
Schema Design in Hive:

Create a structured Hive table with fields like:
Product Details: ProductID, ProductName, Country, Date-Month-Year.
Operational Metrics: Employee roles, salaries, counts, and expenses.
Sales Data: Marketed, sold, and remaining product quantities.
Revenue Metrics: Quarterly and yearly revenue figures, and growth rates from 2021 to 2024.
Customer Feedback: CustomerFeedback, CustomerEmail, CustomerName, AddressName.
Data Processing and Queries:

Use HiveQL to perform:
Aggregation queries to calculate total revenue, average salaries, and growth trends.
Filtering to identify top-performing products by sales and revenue.
Comparisons of marketed and sold quantities to assess inventory efficiency.
Sentiment analysis on CustomerFeedback to gauge satisfaction.
Analysis Goals:

Identify high-revenue and high-growth products.
Optimize operational efficiency by analyzing salary distributions and employee roles.
Understand regional sales patterns and customer behavior.
Predict future trends based on historical growth rates and sales data.
Visualization and Reporting:

Generate reports and dashboards using visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for:
Quarterly and yearly revenue trends.
Product performance by country.
Correlation between salaries, operational metrics, and revenue.
Outcome:
The project provides actionable insights into product performance, sales efficiency, and customer satisfaction. It aids decision-making for marketing strategies, operational cost management, and product optimization to enhance growth and revenue.
